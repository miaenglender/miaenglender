    <h2>Student Grade Tracking System</h2>
    <p>
        Collaborated on a team to develop a student grade tracking system with a user-friendly
        interface that allows professors to input, update, and analyze student grades.
        I led the front-end design and development, focusing on intuitive navigation and
        clean functionality.

    <h2>Swimmer Race Tracking Android App</h2>
    <p>
        Developed an Android application for swimmers to track, analyze, and compare race data.
        The app helps users monitor performance over time and identify areas for improvement.
    </p>

    <h2>Kitchen Visualization Tool</h2>
    <p>
        Worked on an Agile team to develop an interactive kitchen visualization tool using
        JavaFX and Maven. I implemented core UI features such as style selection menus,
        dropdown customization options, and real-time model updates. The project involved
        integrating Figma frontend designs with backend logic to produce a functional prototype.
    </p>

    <h2>Athlete Performance Database</h2>
    <p>
        Designed and implemented a database system for athletes across various sports.
        The system allows users to add athletes, search records, and view meet results
        through an organized and searchable interface.
