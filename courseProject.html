    <h2>Student Grade Tracking System</h2>
    <p>
      Collaborated on a team to develop a student grade tracking system with a user-friendly
      interface that allows professors to input, update, and analyze student grades.
      I led the front-end design and development, focusing on intuitive navigation and
      clean functionality.

    <h2>Kitchen Visualization Tool</h2>
    <p>
      Worked on an Agile team to develop an interactive kitchen visualization tool using
      JavaFX and Maven. I implemented core UI features such as style selection menus,
      dropdown customization options, and real-time model updates. The project involved
      integrating Figma frontend designs with backend logic to produce a functional prototype.

    <h2>Athlete Performance Database</h2>
    <p>
      Designed and implemented a database system for athletes across various sports.
      The system allows users to add athletes, search records, and view meet results
      through an organized and searchable interface.
